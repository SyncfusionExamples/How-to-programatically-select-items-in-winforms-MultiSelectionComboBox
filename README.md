# How-to-programatically-select-items-in-winforms-MultiSelectionComboBox
This example demonstrates how to programmatically select items in the WinForms MultiSelectionComboBox using Syncfusion’s Windows Forms UI components. The MultiSelectionComboBox allows users to select multiple items from a dropdown list, and in many scenarios, it’s useful to pre-select items based on application logic, user preferences, or saved data.
In this sample, items are selected programmatically by accessing the SelectedItem property and setting the desired items to it. This is particularly helpful when you want to initialize the control with default selections or update the selection dynamically based on user actions or external data sources.
Key Implementation Steps:
    • Initialize the MultiSelectionComboBox with a data source.
    • Access the SelectedItem property.
    • Set the required items to the SelectedItem property.
    • Optionally, update the UI or trigger events based on the selection.
    • This approach ensures a dynamic and user-friendly experience, especially in forms or dashboards where multiple selections are essential.
